## Wine Co.

Wine Co. is a Wine e-commerce made with Next.js and Tailwind

### To start the project

- npm run dev

### Better DX

- If you are using VS Code, go to the settings, find the Tailwind class attributes and add `.*Styles*`.
  It will give you Tailwind intellisense when a variable name ends with `Styles`. eg: `const buttonStyles = "text-white"`
